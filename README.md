## Game
This project of Udacity's front-end web development nanodegree is a version of the frogger arcade-game. The basic requirements for this project are the following:

The player has to reach the water without colliding the enemies (bugs).

The player can move up, down, left and right using arrow keys without going out of the grid.

The enemies run on the paved block portion of the scene at various (random) speeds each time they reappear.

The player comes back to his/her initial position when  he/she collides an enemy (a bug) or once he/she won (reaches the water).
This project is about to learn object-oriented programming. All functions must be either class functions or class prototype functions. It is also a good exercice to handle 'this'.
